FollowUp is  a Intra-College Utility Sharing application which allows the senior batch to lend or sell college utilities to their Juniors. It also enables you to share notes with your batchmates. Through FollowUp the Sellers/lenders can list their items with a picture and the buyers/borrowers can apply for taking the item. FollowUp also provides a Razorpay payment gateway for buy option. The solemn purpose of this app is to reuse the used utilities and hence conserving nature.

We have used React and firebase as front and backend respectively. The authentication is done using firebase auth and we have used firestore as database and firebase storage for storing Images. 

We plan to make a mobile application version for the same. We also plan to expand it by adding other features like chatting.
