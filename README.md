FollowUp is  a Intra-College Utility Sharing application which allows the senior batch to lend or sell college utilities to their Juniors. It also enables you to share notes with your batchmates. 
The solemn purpose of this app is to reuse the used utilities and hence conserving nature.

We have used React and firebase as front and backend respectively. The authentication is done using firebase auth and we have used firestore as database and firebase storage for storing Images.
